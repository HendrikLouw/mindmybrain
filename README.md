Mind My Brain
=============

This is all work in progress, in case you've stumbled upon this

An experiment to visualize pieces of information that needs to be
remembered by allowing quick addition of information and linking new
pieces of information with older pieces. Based on [learning by
association](http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/genpsylearning.html)

To aid in learning this should allow for quick and easy adding of any
kind of media
  * Text
  * Pictures
  * Video
  * Audio
  * Links


Ideally the app should try to have some intelligence by:
  * Looking up related topics and providing smart suggestoins with
    information from places like Google, Wikipedia, Wolfram Alfa etc 
  * Finding links between newly typed information and existing
    information
  * Enable quick finding of information and their links
